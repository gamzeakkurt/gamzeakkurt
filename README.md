 <!-- About section -->

---
âœ¨As a passionate engineer, I am enthusiastic about pursuing a career in data science. With a strong background in programming languages and statistical analysis, I am dedicated to leveraging my academic foundation in data science to tackle complex business problems. 

I love sharing my knowledge with others, and I do that through the Kaggle platform. Sometimes I participate in competitions, sometimes I analyze the existing dataset. When I'm not coding, you can find me baking in the kitchen and producing content on Instagram.
